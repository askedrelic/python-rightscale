h1. Python RightScale API

This project aims to give you a more sane interface to RightScale than would
hacking at the REST api yourself.

h2. Current State

This project is a work in progress. If you want features added, file a bug or
send me a patch and it'll get in. If there's a bug, let me know.

We are using it in production at Loggly.com.

h2. Installing

Releases of this can be found on Python PI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rightscale/

h2. Examples

<pre>
from rightscale import RightScale
rsapi = RightScale(account_number, username, password)

# Find 'me' in RightScale.
myself = rsapi.whoami()

# What does RightScale call me? (The server name in the UI)
print myself.nickname

# Change my server name in RightScale
myself.nickname = "New server name"
myself.save()

# What tags do I have?
print myself.tags

# How many servers do we have?
print len(rsapi.servers)
</pre>
